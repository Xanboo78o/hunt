# THE WHEEL

A hunt randomizer that only works outside.

**OBJECT → SPECIES → RULE → MODE**

- **OBJECT** — plant / tree / rock / creature
- **SPECIES** — 12 slices sampled from what actually lives within ~200 miles of you.
  Slice size = real local sighting counts, so the common thing really is the fat slice.
  Plants + creatures from the **iNaturalist** API. Rocks from **Macrostrat** — your real bedrock.
- **RULE** — NIGHT TIME / MORNING / RUN / GOLDEN HOUR / OFF THE PATH / ONE MILE OUT
- **MODE** — CATCH 60% / PHOTOGRAPHY 25% / SPEEDRUN 15%.
  If CATCH lands on something you shouldn't grab (a bird, a mammal, a reptile, or a
  protected species) the app **force-downgrades it to PHOTOGRAPHY on screen.**

Timer runs in the corner from the moment MODE locks, and gets logged with the result.

### The indoor lock
The first wheel won't spin until GPS says you've moved 60 m. There's an override.
Toggle it off in setup if it's ever in your way.

### Tuning
Everything lives in `CFG` at the top of `app.js` — rules, mode weights, slice count,
radius, lock distance. `TREE_GENERA` decides tree vs plant (iNat has no "tree" flag),
so add genera as you notice gaps.

### Needs HTTPS
Geolocation is blocked on plain `http://` except on `localhost`. On your iPad this has
to be served over https, or the location button and the indoor lock both do nothing.
